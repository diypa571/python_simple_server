WebSocket Server Example
This is a basic example of a WebSocket server implemented in Python using the websockets library. The server handles incoming WebSocket connections and messages, and echoes received messages back to the client.

Code Explanation:
import asyncio and import websockets import the necessary modules for working with WebSockets and asynchronous tasks.
async def handle_websocket(websocket, path): is the function that handles incoming WebSocket connections and messages. It is defined as an asynchronous function using the async keyword.
Inside the handle_websocket function:
The message "New WebSocket connection established" is printed when a new connection is established.
An asynchronous loop is set up to continuously listen for incoming messages from the client.
The received message is processed (in this example, it's echoed back to the client using await websocket.send(message)).
Exceptions are caught to handle cases where the connection is closed by the client (websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedOK) or any other unexpected errors.
start_server = websockets.serve(handle_websocket, "localhost", 3000) creates a WebSocket server that listens on localhost and port 3000, and uses the handle_websocket function to handle incoming connections.
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server) starts the WebSocket server and runs it until it is complete.
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever() runs the event loop indefinitely, allowing the server to continuously listen for incoming connections and messages.
Usage:
Install the required dependencies:

Install the required dependencies:

pip install websockets

Run the server by executing the Python script.

The server will start listening on ws://localhost:3000. You can connect to this server using WebSocket clients or integrate it into your application.

When a client establishes a WebSocket connection, the server will print "New WebSocket connection established". The server will then continuously listen for incoming messages.

Any messages received by the server will be echoed back to the client.

Feel free to modify the handle_websocket function to implement custom logic or actions based on the received messages.

Please note that this is a basic example and may require additional error handling, security measures, or performance optimizations depending on your specific use case.
